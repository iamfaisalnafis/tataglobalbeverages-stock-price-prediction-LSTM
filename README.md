## Project Title
Tata Global Beverages Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

## Project Description
This project aims to predict the stock prices of Tata Global Beverages using LSTM, a popular neural network architecture for sequence prediction tasks. The project uses the historical stock prices of Tata Global Beverages and trains an LSTM model to predict future stock prices. The dataset used in the project is obtained from Yahoo Finance and includes various features such as Open, High, Low, and Close prices, as well as the trading volume.

The project is divided into several parts, including data preprocessing, model building, training, and testing. Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, scaling the data, and splitting it into training and testing sets. The model building part involves defining the LSTM architecture, compiling the model, and fitting it to the training data. Training the model involves setting up the training parameters and fitting the model to the training data. Finally, the testing part involves evaluating the model's performance on the testing data.

## Requirements
The project requires the following Python libraries to be installed:

`numpy`

`pandas`

`matplotlib`

`scikit-learn`

`keras`

The project code is written in Python and requires Jupyter notebook to run. The project is tested on Python 3.7.

## Usage
To run the project, simply open the Jupyter notebook file and run each cell in order. The notebook includes detailed explanations of each step of the process, as well as visualizations of the results.

## Results
The LSTM model achieves a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0015 on the testing data, indicating that the model is capable of making accurate predictions of Tata Global Beverages stock prices. The project also includes visualizations of the predicted and actual stock prices over time, allowing for easy comparison of the model's performance.

## Future Work
Possible future improvements to the project include experimenting with different LSTM architectures, incorporating additional features into the model, and exploring other machine learning algorithms for stock price prediction.
